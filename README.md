# Gender-prediction-from-voice-data--random-forest

Build a Gender Recognition classifier using the Random Forest algorithm from the voice dataset. The idea is to identify a voice as male or female, based upon the acoustic properties of the voice and speech. The dataset consists of 3,168 recorded voice samples, collected from male and female speakers. The voice samples are pre-processed by acoustic analysis in R using the seewave and tuneR packages, with an analyzed frequency range of 0hz-280hz.

The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/primaryobjects/voicegender

The goal is to create a Decision tree and Random Forest classifier and compare the accuracy of both the models.
